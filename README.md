# Fire Emblem Einherjar Extravaganza Editor

This is a ROM editor to create hacked GBA Fire Emblem games that open a gate to the Outrealms and kidnap adventurers from all other editions to fight for you in your chosen ROM.

**IMPORTANT**

Create a backup or copy of your ROM and use that as the ROM. This doesn't create a new ROM (probably should) at the moment, so it'll overwrite whatever you have existing.

###Simple Instructions (Windows only):

1. Download boogaloo.zip
2. Run the "run" executeable and follow the instructions

###Other Instructions (Everyone else):

1. Download and install Python 3.5
2. Download the code .ZIP and unzip it
3. Open a terminal/shell and move to the code folder
4. Run `python boogaloo.py \<YOUR ROM\>`
5. (Optional) Run `python boogaloo.py \<YOUR ROM\> \<REPLACEMENT FILE\>`
6. Enjoy the Boogaloo!

You can set which characters you want to replace if you're doing a special Pick My Units, if you want, by supplying a file of the format

\<old character\>*,* \<GAME\> \<new character\>
